                                Hi, I'm a musician turned coder. I still create music, but lately I've been shifting
                                more towards the production side of it. I used to score short films, often
                                collaborating on these scores with my brother, but I no longer do that. I studied
                                music with an emphasis on composition along with a handful computer science and game
                                development courses. I also pursued some self-guided learning in Assembly language
                                to explore NES game development, and I dabbled in some basic web development. Just
                                before graduating, I decided to further my software development skills by enrolling
                                in an online course on full-stack web development and pursue a career in that field.
                                <br><br>
                                The outdated look of this website is intentional. I wanted to create a site in
                                the style of the mid-2000s, which was when I started getting into the internet. Most
                                of the assets used were drawn by myself.
